# Aerial Robotics Week 3
## Planning and Control: 2-D Quadrotor Control

<strong>Task:</strong> Implement the PD controller in <i>`controller.m`</i> so that the simulated quadrotor can follow a desired trajectory. The controller is tested with two trajectories, the first one is a horizontal line trajectory and the second one is a sine wave shaped trajectory.

<strong>Goal:</strong> Get your controller to follow each trajectory such that the cumulative error between the desired position from the trajectory and the actual position of the quadrotor is below the 0.15 threshold (line trajectory) and the 0.20 threshold (sine wave trajectory).
