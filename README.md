# Aerial Robotics Week 2
## Geometry and Mechanics: 1-D Quadrotor Control (vertical axis)

<strong>Task:</strong> Implement the PD controller for height control of the quadrotor. Tune the proportional (Kp) and derivative (Kv) gain in <i>`controller.m`</i>

<strong>Goal:</strong> Quick and smooth covergence to a step response input.
