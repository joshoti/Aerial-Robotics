## Week 1: PD (Proportional-Derivative) Tuning of Quadrotor
<strong>Task:</strong> Tune the Kp (Proportional) gain of the system while the Kv (Derivative) gain is kept constant, observing different rates of covergence with different parameters.

<strong>Goal:</strong> Get a response which has a rise time less than 1 second and a maximum overshoot of less than 5%
